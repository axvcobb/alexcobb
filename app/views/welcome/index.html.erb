        <p class="card-text">Hello World! I am an Atlanta based Software Engineer with a Computer Science degree. I graduated in 2018 but have been coding professionally since 2015. I am a full-stack engineer, but I primarily work on the back-end. I love messing around with new languages and technologies.</p>
        <p class="card-text">When I'm not at work or doing side projects, I spend my hours hiking, brewing my own beer, cooking some crazy dishes, and playing with my dog, Taco. I've also recently gotten into running with the hope of running a full marathon later this year. I love connecting with people so feel free to send me an email!</p>

        <p class="card-text">This website is my latest project. While this page is just static HTML/CSS, the <%= link_to "blog", posts_path %> and <%= link_to "races", races_path %> pages are built with Ruby on Rails.</p>
        <p class="card-text">While the blog is a very basic CRUD, the running page is what got me excited for this website. In 2019, I ran 9 races but had no place to see the full list of when they were&mdash;I was forced to click through my calendar to remind myself what was coming up next. I built the running portion to keep track of all races, both upcoming and past, as well as my results for each. I am going to continue to add features to this section of the website so be sure to keep an eye on the blog for release notes of these new features.</p>

        <p class="card-text">This project came from a personal need to track my homebrewing recipes as they change over time. These recipes can be exported into a standardized XML structure called BeerXML. BeerVC is built with Java and SQLite. It parses the BeerXML and keeps a versioned history of each recipe as well as the diff from version to version. It is currently a work in progress so please check back.</p>

        <p class="card-text">I worked on a team of six to build an Android app and custom Alexa skill that allowed people to customize and play a Dungeons and Dragons style game. The Android app served as the UI and campaign creator while Alexa served as the "Dungeon Master". Both the app and skill were built using Java. We used Google Firebase as the database to link the two platforms.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The group of six was split up into two groups where one group focused on the app development while the other focused on the skill development. To keep everyone familiar with the entire codebase, the Alexa team was in charge of the QA, code reviews, and testing of the app, and vice versa. We used git for version control and agile methodologies for project management.</p>
